### Example

Here is a practice **personal decision** about the two options you just rated. In Option 1, ***[aspect1]*** increases by [tradeoff1]. In Option 2, ***[aspect2]*** increases by [tradeoff2]. You must select "I prefer this option" for one of the options. If you feel strongly that it does not make sense to choose between the two options, you can check the box below which says "This decision does not make sense."
