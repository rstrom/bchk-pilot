### Instructions
In this survey you will be asked to answer two types of questions.

In the first type of question, we will ask you to rate various aspects of **your life** or the **lives of people in your nation**, based on the past year (12 months). We will call questions about your own life **personal ratings** and call questions about the lives of people in your nation **policy ratings**.

In the second type of question, we will ask you to choose between two options which would change some aspect of **your life**, or the **lives of people in your nation**, during the next year (12 months). We will call questions about your own life **personal decisions** and call questions about the lives of people in your nation **policy decisions**.

Please try to answer every question the best you can. (The aspects and decisions are randomly chosen by the computer so that we learn as much as possible from your choices. We learn the most if you pay careful attention in all your choices.)

Next we will give you some practice questions: two **personal ratings**, one **personal decision**, two **policy ratings**, and one **policy decision**.
