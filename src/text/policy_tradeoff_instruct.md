Imagine you are making a **policy decision**, facing a choice between two options: Option 1 and Option 2. The two options will have different effects over the next year of **the lives of people in your nation** but no difference after that. You should assume that all other aspects of **the lives of people in your nation** that are not shown in these options will be the same as last year. Between these two options, which do you think you would choose? Select “I prefer this option” for the option you would choose.
